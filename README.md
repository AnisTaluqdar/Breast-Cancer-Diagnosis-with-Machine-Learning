# BCDML (Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning)

### Overview

This project aims to build a machine-learning model that accurately classifies breast tumors as benign or malignant based on cell nucleus features. The dataset used for this analysis is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset1. We will explore the data, apply various classification techniques, and recommend the best model.

### Dataset Description

**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)

**Features:** 30 numerical features describing cell nucleus properties

**Target Variable:** Binary classification (Benign or Malignant)
